To allow emails to be sent, go to application properties and follow those steps also in the controller, change any references from sinanikleriya19@gmail.com to an email of your choice so emails get sent to that user.
Also create a database called mydb with the credentials of root(default username) and password as sinanisapro.
This is a test email verification project so the project structure is not structured professionally.
